# A new implemenation of the QNICE CPU

## TODO
* Cleanup code.
* Formal verification.
* Cycle Optimizations (see below).
* Add interrupts.
* Timing optimizations.


## Cycle Optimizations:
1. Let the FETCH module present two (or three) words to the DECODE module, so the latter doesn't have to wait.
2. Eliminate the NOP cycle from the CMP @R1, @PC++ instruction.
3. Optimize conditional jumps, so they don't execute superfluous microoperations.
4. Optimize FETCH module. It currently takes three clock cycles after a jump. This could be reduced to one clock cycle.

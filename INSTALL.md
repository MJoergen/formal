# Installing tools for formal verification

Getting formal verification to work in VHDL requires quite a lot of manual
setup and install; it would seem the tools are not quite mature yet.
Anyway, I managed to get it working in the end.

In order to use formal verification of VHDL, you need to install a bunch of tools, as explained below:
* Yosys, SymbiYosys, and some SAT solvers
* GNAT, GHDL, and the ghdl-yosys-plugin

## Install Yosys, SymbiYosys, and some SAT solvers
This is described in detail in [this link](https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
and is actually pretty straight forward.

However, I did run into two problems:

The first problem is I needed to install an additional package:

```
sudo apt install python3-sphinx
```

The second problem is that on my machine (running Linux Mint 19.3 with GCC 9.3)
I ran into the following error when building the Avy project:

```
extavy/avy/src/ItpMinisat.h:127:52: error: cannot convert ‘boost::logic::tribool’ to ‘bool’ in return
  127 |     bool isSolved () { return m_Trivial || m_State || !m_State; }
      |                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~
      |                                                    |
      |                                                    boost::logic::tribool
```

I fixed this by applying the following patch:

```

   };

Everything else worked fine just be following the instructions in the above link.

## Install GNAT, GHDL, and the ghdl-yosys-plugin

The details are described [here](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin) and is again
pretty straight forward.
